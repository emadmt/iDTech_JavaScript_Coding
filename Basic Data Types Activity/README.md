# Working with Basic Data Types Activity
In this project you have to create 3 different variables by types. One of them is string that is representing your name, the second variable is an integer and it shouws the number of cities you've visited. The last variable is a bool type and it answers the question if you are having fun or not. As a result the console prints those results.
